# Automatic-Street-Light-using-LDR
Introduction - 
Automatic Street Light Control System is a simple and powerful concept, which uses transistor as a switch to switch ON and OFF the street light automatically. By using thissystem manual works are removed. It automatically switches ON lights when the sunlight goes below the visible region of our eyes. It automatically switches OFF lights under illumination by sunlight.This is done by a sensor called Light Dependant Resistor (LDR) which senses the light actually likeour eyes . By using this system energy consumption is also reduced because now-a-days the manuallyoperated street lights are not switched off properly even the sunlight comes and also not switched onearlier before sunset. In sunny and rainy days, ON time and OFF time differ significantly which isone of the major disadvantage of using timer circuits or manual. This project exploits the working ofa transistor in saturation region and cut-off region to switch ON and switch OFF the lights aappropriate time with the help of an electromagnetically operated switch. A street light, lamppost, street lamp, light standard, or lamp standard is a raised source of light on the edge of a road or walkway, which is turned on or lit at a certain timeevery night. Modern lamps may also have light-sensitive photocells to turn them on at dusk, off atdawn, or activate automatically in dark weather. In older lighting this function would have been performed with the aid of a solar dial. It is not uncommon for street lights to be on poles which havewires strung between them, or mounted on utility poles. This project exploits the working of a transistor in saturation region and cut-off region to switch ON and switch OFF the lights at appropriate time with the help of an electromagnetically operated switch Automatic Streetlight needs no manual operation of switching ON and OFF. The system itself detects whether there is need for light or not.

Working -
During the daytime when there is a light, the LDR has very low resistance and all voltage coming through R1 dropped with the ground. This makes the voltage at the base of the transistor very low and it will not switch ON the transistor. Because the transistor is OFF, the current will not flow through the transistor. As a result, LED will not turn ON. At night when there is no light, the LDR has high resistance and very less power dropped with the ground. This makes the voltage at the base of the transistor high to turn the transistor ON. Because the transistor is turned ON, current flows through the transistor. It flows from the positive battery terminal, through R2, the LED, and the transistor down to the negative battery terminal. As a result, the LED turns ON.

Applications of Automatic Street Light Using LDR:
1.Photo resistors are applied, most of which involve recognizing the presence of light.
2.Photo resistors are also used in digital cameras to perceive how much light camera sees and adjust the picture quality accordingly.
3.They are also used in some clocks, alarms, and other electronic devices that are semi-dependent on sunlight.
4.Smoke detection.
5.Automatic lighting control.
6.Burglar alarm systems.
7.Camera (electronic shutter).
8.Strobe (color temperature reading).

Advantages of Automatic street lights using LDR:
1.Increased pedestrian satisfaction through improved safety measures;
3.Lowered repair and maintenance costs with the monitoring software;
4.Reduced carbon emissions and light pollution;
5.Increased lamp life and shorter response times to outages;
6.Improved architectural planning based on real traffic patterns and insights; and
7.Increased revenue opportunities, such as leasing poles for digital signage or other services.

Disadvantages of Automatic street lights using LDR:
1.Can be more intricate to align detector pairs.
2.Is sensitive to ambient light and require careful shielding.
3.photo resistors are only sensitive to light and no other force can power it without risking damage. Also, they are unable to detect low light levels and may take a few seconds to deliver a charge while
their electrons build up momentum.

Conclusion :
The Streetlight controller using ldr based Light intensity & traffic density, in the todays up growing countries will be more effective in case of cost, manpower and security as compare with today's running complicated and complex light controlling systems. Automatic Street Light Controlling System puts up a very user friendly approach and could increase the power This paperelaborates the design and construction of automatic street control system circuit. Circuit worksproperly to turn street lamp ON/OFF. After designing the circuit which controls the light of the street as illustrated in the previous sections. LDR sensor and the photoelectric sensors are the two main conditions in working the circuit. If the two conditions have been satisfied the circuit will do the desired work according to specific program.
